### Hi there 👋

👽 My name is Ivan <br/>
🔑 I'm a Blockchain Smart Contract developer who is passionate about creating innovative solutions in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space <br/>
🍄 Currently, I work at Mycelium Lab, where I contribute to the development of cutting-edge blockchain-based applications <br/>
🎵 I love producing music, creating games, and programming microcontrollers <br/>

💻 Notable projects I worked on: 
  - 🚀 UNO.farm - a Yield Farming Aggregator protocol that allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrency holdings by staking them in liquidity pools
  - 📝 dWill.app - a Decentralized non-custodial inheritance protocol that enables users to securely transfer their digital assets to their beneficiaries
  - 🌎 BDNS.app - an ENS fork that offers an ability to register and manage TLD domains on the Ethereum blockchain
  - 🎟️ eesee - an NFT marketplace that allows creators to mint and sell their digital assets through a raffle system

I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out to me!
